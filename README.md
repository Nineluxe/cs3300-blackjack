# CS 3300 Web-Based Blackjack
A simple game of Blackjack designed to be hosted on itch.io

# Description
Blackjack is a card game where the objective is to get as closest to 21 as possible without going over. Our project is simplified version of Blackjack in Python, designed to be hosted on itch.io so it can be played in a browser. This game includes GUI features such as buttons to “hit” or end the round, and it allows players to compete against the computer to determine the winner.
